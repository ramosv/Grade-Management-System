    It is using Inheritance by Using the properties and methods from the 
    Parent class course. Only difference between an advancecourse is that
    it has an extra cost, but every other property is the same.
    Now there is no need to ReWrite all that code because a Advance course 
    is inhering the features from Course Class.
